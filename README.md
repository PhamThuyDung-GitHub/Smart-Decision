## Data
This report conducts research on the causes, consequences, and damage of tsunamis based on the Global Historical Tsunami Database.  

`Tsunami_Cut.csv`
This dataset represents historical tsunamis and related information, providing data on over 2,400 tsunamis from 2100 BC to the present in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas. This dataset download from NCEI Global Historical Hazard Database (noaa.gov)

## Conclusion
After analysis, we have some conclusions. Firstly, the main cause of tsunamis is earthquakes, the year with the highest number of deaths by tsunami is the 2000s. Secondly, Japan has the highest number of Tsunami.  Moreover, Most of Tsunami has Earthquake magnitude range in 7-8. Then, Tsunamis occur most frequently in August each year. Lastly, in data mining, the data used for analysis gives quite good results, highlighting visualization of data on the causes, deaths, and damages of Tsunamis. In Comparison, Kmeans appears to be the most balanced and effective clustering method overall, with agglomerative clustering also being a strong contender, especially in terms of intra-cluster similarity. Birch is less effective in this comparison.

### Summary report
The report details the process of designing a data warehouse and using tools like SSIS and SSAS to analyze tsunami data. Various SQL queries are employed to extract insights about tsunami occurrences, deaths, damage, and related factors. The study uses PowerBI for data reporting and pivot tables for statistical analysis. Data mining techniques, including clustering algorithms, are applied to visualize patterns in the dataset. Ultimately, the analysis concludes that earthquakes are the primary cause of tsunamis, with Japan experiencing the highest frequency, and the 2000s being the deadliest period.
